<h1>FAQ</h1>

<div id="maincontent">

    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px">Do all operators require training?</h2>
    <p>Yes. It is a legal requirement that all operators have recognised training for the equipment being used.</p>

    <h2>Do operators have to be retested?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Under Health & Safety guidelines, operators of forklift trucks must be retested at regular intervals,
        normally every 3 years.</p>

    <h2>Are managers / supervisors required to be trained?</h2>
    <p>Yes. PUWER Regulations 1998 state that " all persons who supervise or manage the use of work equipment have
        received adequate training for the purpose of Health & Safety".</p>

    <h2>Do machines have to be inspected daily?</h2>
    <p>Yes. A qualified forklift operator must inspect forklifts at the start of every shift. (we can provide daily
        check sheets for equipment).</p>

    <h2>Will the certification cover our company for Health & Safety and Insurance purposes?</h2>
    <p>Yes. All Saunders Training Centre forklift truck training Instructors and examiners are fully accredited with
        <a href="https://www.itssar.org.uk/">ITSSAR</a> (Independent Training Standards Scheme and Register), <a href="http://npors.com/">NPORS</a> (National Plant Operators Registration
        Scheme) <a href="https://www.allmi.com/">ALLMI</a> (Association of Lorry Loader Manufacturers and Importers). All training courses are to the
        National Standards.</p>

    <h2>Will one certificate cover an operator for all machines?</h2>
    <p>No. Certification will only cover an operator for the piece of equipment that they have undergone training
        for. For instance, a counterbalance licence will not cover an operator for a reach truck.</p>

    <h2>Can training be completed on our company premises?</h2>
    <p>Yes. On-site training is a good idea; it gives operators practice in the working environment. Sufficient room
        must be given for practical off job training.</p>

    <h2>Is there an age requirement for forklift operators?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Operators must be over the minimum school leaving age of 16, unless operating in dockyards where the age
        requirement is 18 or over.</p>

    <h2>Do operators need a car driving licence?</h2>
    <p>No. A driving licence for a car is not needed unless forklifts are being driven on the road.</p>

    <h2>How many candidates can attend a course?</h2>
    <p>The maximum number of trainees that can attend a course is three.</p>
